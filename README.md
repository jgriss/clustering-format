# clustering-format

## Introduction

This project aims at developing a standard file format for MS2 based clustering results.

Currently, two major decisions need to be taken, each of which is tracked by an issue in this repository:
1) Decide whether to base the format on mzTab or create a new XML based format (Issue #1)
2) Define the required information needed to be stored (Issue #2)

## Clustering Results in mzTab

A first possible specification of how clustering results could be represented in mzTab is presented [https://github.com/jgriss/clustering-format/blob/master/clustering_extension_mzTab.docx?raw=true](here).
